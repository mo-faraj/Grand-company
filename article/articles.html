            <p>
              The graphics processor in the computer is considered one of the
              necessary components that cannot be dispensed with and cannot be
              overlooked. When you need to use the computer for design or
              engineering programs, you must pay great attention to this piece.
              Also, the graphics card has a special architecture that controls
              the number of frames that the computer supports.

            <h2>RAM (random access memory)</h2>
            <p>
              Random access memory (RAM) is the hardware in a computing device
              that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS),
              software programs and any other data in current use so they're
              quickly available to the device's processor. RAM is often referred
              to as a computer's main memory, as opposed to the processor cache
              or other memory types. Random access memory is considered part of
              a computer's primary memory. It is much faster to read from and
              write to than secondary storage, such as hard disk drives (HDDs),
              solid-state drives (SSDs) or optical drives. However, RAM is
              volatile; it retains data only as long as the computer is on. If
              power is lost, so is the data. When the computer is rebooted, the
              OS and other files must be reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD
              or SSD.

            <h2>Central processing unit</h2>
            <p>
              The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a
              computer that acts as its “control center.” The CPU, also referred
              to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of
              electronic circuitry that runs the machine’s operating system and
              apps. The CPU interprets, processes and executes instructions,
              most often from the hardware and software programs running on the
              device. The CPU performs arithmetic, logic, and other operations
              to transform data input into more usable information output. While
              the CPU must contain at least one processing core, many contain
              multiple cores. A server with two hexa-core CPUs, for example,
              will have a total of 12 processors.

              computer printer is a piece of hardware for a computer. It allows
              a user to print items on paper, such as letters and pictures.
              Usually a printer prints under the control of a computer. Many can
              also work as a photocopier or with a digital camera to print
              directly without using a computer Printers are programmed using a
              programming language. The printer interprets the program, and the
              outputs the result. There are two big classes of such languages:
              Page description languages, and Printer Control languages. A page
              description language describes what a page should look like. The
              program in a page description language is sent to the printer,
              which interprets them. Printer command languages are at a lower
              level than Page description languages, they contain information
              that is specific to the printer model. Common programming
              languages for printers

              HDD vs SSD: Key Differences While solid-state drives (SSDs) and
              hard disk drives (HDD) allow users to store files, they work
              differently. Many of the differences between solid-state drives
              (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDD) come from advances in
              technology. Reading process The reading process is how hard disk
              drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) retrieve data on their
              devices. When you ask the hard disk drive (HDD) to retrieve data,
              a signal is sent to the input/output (I/O) controller. The
              controller then sends signals to the actuator arm telling it where
              the data is needed. By reading bit charges at this address, the
              read/write head collects data. HDD latency measures how long it
              takes for the drive arm to move to the correct track and sector.
              Solid state drives have no moving parts. When you try to retrieve
              data, the SSD controller finds the address of this data block and
              begins reading its charge. If the cluster is idle, a process
              called garbage collection begins. This process clears inactive
              blocks and frees them to store new data.
